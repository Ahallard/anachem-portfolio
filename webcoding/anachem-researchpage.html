            <p>we started off our research with a problem statement and user needs statement.
                <br/>
                This helped understand the problem from the potenial users view, which is that the user
                needs a tool to quickly and effectively document customers, orders, order statis
                and how work they have done.
                <br/>
            </p>
            <p>
                Then moved onto competitive analysis, user personas and user stories to understand 
                who the users are, and how others handled this problem. 
                <br/>
                we then moved onto empathy maps and low fidelity wireframes. 
                <br/>
                You can see our work on competitive analysis, user personas and user stories
                 in the gallery page.
